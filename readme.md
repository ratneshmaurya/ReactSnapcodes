* **Flexible Routing:** Implement navigation options like in-app routing, user authentication flows, and dynamic URL handling.
* **Context API State Management:** Share data efficiently across components without prop drilling, ideal for global state or UI themes.
* **Smooth Scrolling Behavior:** Enhance user experience with smooth scrolling effects for content sections, animations, and navigation.
* **Additional Utilities:** Leverage a `utils` directory containing helper functions, common logic, and reusable patterns to streamline development.
* **Other Useful React Codes**

Easily incorporate these components into your React projects to accelerate development, improve code maintainability, and build beautiful UIs.
